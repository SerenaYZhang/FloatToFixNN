This directory includes my intern work at Rutger's WINLAB for the project “High Speed Training Using Binary Neural Networks (NN).”
I worked on the task of evaluating the relationship of the accuracy of NN and different float number (NN weights) truncation settings using Go language.

It includes the following files:

1. My research report: [WINLAB Truncation Experiment Results.pdf](./WINLAB%20Truncation%20Experiment%20Results.pdf).
2. Our team's final poster: Final Poster.pdf.
3. Two go files in which I did the intrumentation and got the results for my study. The change was made on top of files in https://github.com/sausheong/gonn.

See https://www.orbit-lab.org/wiki/Other/Summer/2021/OH2021 for all posters from WINLAB summer interns in 2021.
